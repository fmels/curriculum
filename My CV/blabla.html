Hey there, thanks for having a look! I am Floyd Melssen, by day a mild-mannered <b>software tester</b> and <b>web developer<b>. By turns I am a reader of gloomy and/or Russian novels, linguistic papers. When not indoors, I enjoy hiking in the mountains, of which we have very little in the aptly named Low Countries.
