<p>Welcome to my website. My name is Floyd Melssen and I am an avid, yet mild-mannered <b>software tester</b>. With a keen eye and an out-of-the-box approach I like to tackle software that is under development and see under what circumstances your system can be broken. Additionally I have experience in <b>web development</b>, a combination that you might find, works especially well.</p>

<p>Like most other people, there are some core qualities. I am <b>analytical</b> and like to dissect logical problems into manageable components. For me, <b>communication</b> is key and I believe that getting the message across is a vital point in the solution to your problem. Furthermore, I am a social <b>team player</b>, but at the same time capable of working autonomously. Generally, I am very motivated and enthusiastic and if I'm not, that probably means its feeding time.</p> 

<p>Apart from testing and developing I enjoy being outdoors and if there's time, I go out hiking in the mountains, of which we unfortunately have little in the  aptly named Low Countries. When indoors, I am an reader of gloomy and/or Russian novels and linguistic papers (neither gloomy nor Russian). I support <a href="http://www.nec-nijmegen.nl">my local team</a>.</p>
